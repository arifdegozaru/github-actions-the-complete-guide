# GitHub Actions — Summary

## What Are GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a **workflow automation service** provided by GitHub.  
It allows you to automate processes related to your repositories such as building, testing, deploying, and managing code workflows.

## What Is a Repository?
A repository (repo) is a **container for your code**—applications, packages, libraries, or websites.  
GitHub hosts these repositories in the cloud, enabling version control and collaboration.

# CI/CD Overview

## Continuous Integration (CI)
Automatically:
- Build new or changed code  
- Test the code  
- Integrate updates into the main branch  

## Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)
Automatically:
- Publish or deploy new releases  
- Trigger deployments after successful CI  

CI/CD focuses on automating the validation, integration, and release of code changes.

# Understanding Git & GitHub

## What Is Git?
Git is a **local version control system** used to:
- Track code changes with commits  
- Create and switch branches  
- Roll back to earlier snapshots  
- Work on multiple versions simultaneously  

## What Is GitHub?
GitHub is a **cloud platform built on top of Git**, providing:
- Cloud repositories (public or private)  
- Collaboration tools (Issues, Projects, Pull Requests)  
- Access control  
- Automation services like GitHub Actions  

GitHub enables backup, collaboration, and cloud-based development workflows.

You can automate:
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Build/test/deploy steps  
- Code reviews  
- Issue & PR workflows  
- General repository and project management  

It streamlines development by making integration, testing, and deployment fully automated.
